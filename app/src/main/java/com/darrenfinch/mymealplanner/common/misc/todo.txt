TODO:
Add ability to add meals. To do this:
1. Create AllFoodsFragment and corresponding ViewModel for the All Foods screen.
2. The All Foods screen needs to support the following operations:
    a. Getting all foods
    b. Inserting and updating foods by opening up the AddEditFoodFragment (could be a dialog)
    c. Deleting foods
3. Since we need to create food types to test, AddEditFoodFragment needs to be created before AllFoodsFragment or AllFoodsViewModel.
4. Once the All Foods screen is finished, we can test the functionality for adding meals, so finish AddEditMealFragment.
5. To finish AddEditMealFragment, when "addNewFood" is clicked, we'll need a screen that displays a list of foods to chose from.
   This screen will display foods without their "view more" icon.
   When the food is clicked, the screen will route to a new screen which allows you to change the quantity of the food and see the macros.
   Once the user is satisfied with the food and quantity, he can click "Done" which will route back to the AddEditMealFragment (passing the food id of course).
   Then the AddEditMealFragment will give that id to the view model to update its list of food ids.
   Once this list is updated, the list of foods shown in the AddEditMealFragment is updated too.
