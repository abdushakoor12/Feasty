TODO:
Add ability to add meals. To do this:
1. Create AllFoodsFragment and corresponding ViewModel for the All Foods screen.
2. The All Foods screen needs to support the following operations:
    a. Getting all foods
    b. Inserting and updating foods by opening up the AddEditFoodFragment (could be a dialog)
    c. Deleting foods
3. Since we need to create food types to test, AddEditFoodFragment needs to be created before AllFoodsFragment or AllFoodsViewModel.
4. Once the All Foods screen is finished, we can test the functionality for adding meals, so finish AddEditMealsFragment.
